1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I can't believe we've never
done this. It's so good!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's so good for Monica.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Time's up! My turn.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
-That was half an hour?
-It's your timer.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I don't like to brag about it,
but I give the best massages.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
All right, then massage me up
right nice!

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's so good, isn't it?

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I don't know what
I did to deserve it.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Say goodbye to sore muscles!

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Goodbye, muscles!

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The One with Joey's Bag

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
She gives the worst massages ever!

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It was like she was torturing me
for information.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I wanted to give it up.
I just didn't know what it was!

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If it hurts that bad,
you should tell her.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
For the first time,
I'm in a real relationship.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I won't screw that up
by telling the truth.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Dude, look out!

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You almost crushed my hat.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Sorry.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And the bunny got away.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This would be the place
where you explain the hat.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
There's this play, right?

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm up for the part of this
cool, suave, international guy.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
A clothes horse, so I figure. . .

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
. . .everyone at the audition will
wear ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And you'll make them disappear?

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Like you could find something
this sophisticated.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Done!

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If you want to look good,
come to the store. I'll help you.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
-Thanks!
-Sure.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Please, take those off!

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hey, Pheebs. How's it going?

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Only okay. Because I just
got back from the hospital.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Are you all right?

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm fine.
But my grandma sort of died.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Pheebs, sorry.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's okay.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
She had a really incredible life.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's not like I won't see her again.
She'll visit.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Maybe she's with us right now.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Right. She's on a new spiritual plain
and she'll come to the coffeehouse.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I just saw two people having sex
in a car right outside!

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Pheebs' grandmother just died.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Actually, it's kind of cool.
Because it's like. . .

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
. . . .you know, one life ends
and another begins.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Not the way they're doing it.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What happened?
How did she die?

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We were in the market. . .

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
. . .and she bent down to get some yogurt
and never came back up again.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm so sorry.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The last thing she said was:

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
"You get the eggs, I'll get the yogurt,
and we'll meet at the checkout counter. "

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You know what?

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We will meet at the checkout counter.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Since you're returning
all this stuff. . .

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
. . .you'll have to wear underwear.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
All right.
You'd better show me that too.

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's missing something.

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Really? A purse?

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's not a purse.
It's a shoulder bag.

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It looks like a woman's purse.

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Trust me, all the men are carrying
them in the spring catalog.

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
See, look.
Men carrying the bag.

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
See, look.
Women carrying the bag.

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But it is odd how a woman's purse
looks so good on me, a man.

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Exactly. Unisex!

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Maybe you need sex.
I had sex a couple days ago.

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
No, Joey. U-N-l sex.

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I ain't going to say no to that!

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
-Who is it?
-It's Phoebe.

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh, great!

75
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Oh, you.

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What's up?

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Well, I sort of have some bad news.
Can I come in?

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
No, thanks.

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Grandma died today.

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Didn't she die like five years ago?

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
No, she just died today.

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We're having
a memorial service tomorrow.

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay, I know I went to that already.

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No, you didn't!

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Then who's been dead?

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Lots of people!

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Look, are you coming or not?

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I thought she was dead,
so I've made my peace.

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Plus I'm going to a concert.

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'd invite you,
but I only have two tickets left.

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
-Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
-Thanks. Enjoy your funeral!

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You look just like your son,
Mrs. Tribbiani.

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What? Are you referring
to my man's bag?

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I thought it just looked good,
but it's practical too.

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's got compartments for your
wallet, keys, address book. . . .

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Your makeup.

97
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What are you doing?
The audition's tomorrow.

98
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You get mustard on that bag,
you can't return it.

100
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Why would I return this?
I love this bag!

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
-All right, then you owe me $350.
-Fine.

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Do you take Vasa or Mooster Card?

103
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Relax, I'll pay you with the money
from the job I'll get. Thanks to you.

104
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What's the part? Auntie Mame?

105
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Don't listen to them.
I think it's sexy.

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You-and-l sexy?

107
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hello, Mrs. Pinilla.
Thank you for coming.

108
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Here's your 3-D glasses.

109
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Reverend Pong will say
when to put them on.

110
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Hi, sweetie.

111
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
-How are you holding up?
-Fine.

112
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Hey, Pheebs. I'm so sorry.

113
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You know what?
My grandma had the exact same bag!

114
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I brought you flowers.

115
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh, thanks!

116
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Pulling flowers out
makes the bag look masculine.

117
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Excuse me, is this the memorial?

118
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Welcome.

119
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Here's your 3-D glasses.

120
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
All right.

121
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So how did you know Frances?

122
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Actually, I hadn't seen her for years.

123
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But I was pretty tight
with her and her daughter.

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What's your name?

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Frank Buffay.

126
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You know what? Strike that.
My name, actually, is Joe.

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Joe Hill.

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You're Frank Buf--

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
No! Joe Hill.

130
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You just said--

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I got to go.
Thank you so much for coming.

132
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Oh, my God!

133
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What happened?

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That was my dad.

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Check it out!

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's like it's coming right at me.

137
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
-Did you catch him?
-What did he say?

138
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He said, "Nice to meet you, Glenda. "

139
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I couldn't give him my real name.

140
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Why not?

141
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You saw the way he ran.

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You think he'd talk
to the daughter he abandoned?

143
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What did you say to him?

144
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I said I was the executor of the will
and I needed to talk to him.

145
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm going to meet him
at the coffeehouse.

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Could everyone take their seats?

147
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I just can't think about that now.

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I want to say goodbye to my grandma.

149
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Let's go say goodbye.

150
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm off to my audition.
How do I look?

151
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Great!
That bag will get you that part.

152
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And a date with a man.

153
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You know what? Make fun all you want.
This is a great bag.

154
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And it's as handy as it is becoming.

155
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Just because you don't understand
something, doesn't make it wrong.

156
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You guys have to get used
to the fact that Joey. . .

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
. . .comes with a bag!

158
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I've got to meet my dad.

159
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Will you tell him who you are?

160
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Not at first.
I don't want to freak him out.

161
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But aren't you pissed at him?

162
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
This guy abandoned you.

163
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
If it were me, this guy would be
in some serious physical danger.

164
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'd walk in there,
I'd be like, "Yo, Dad!

165
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You and me, outside.
Right now! "

166
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I kind of scared myself.

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Well, at least you scared someone.

168
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You'd think I'd be angry.

169
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You'd think I'd want to rip
his tiny little head off!

170
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Fortunately, I'm past it.

171
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You do seem a little tense.
Here, let me help you.

172
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Get off!

173
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Stop it!
Why are you doing that to me?

174
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What are you talking about?

175
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
As a masseuse and a human. . .

176
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
. . .I'm begging you,
never do that to anyone!

177
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I give good massages.

178
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I gave them to Rachel
before she got allergic.

179
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And Chandler, he loves them!
Watch.

180
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
He does not like it.
He's in pain!

181
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
-No, he's not.
-Yes, he is!

182
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
-What?
-I'm sorry but--

183
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You've been lying to me?

184
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I can't believe that.

185
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Maybe he didn't want to hurt you.

186
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But the minute we start
to lie to each other--

187
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And by "we" . . .

188
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
. . .I mean society.

189
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Anytime you're ready.

190
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Well, you must be new here.

191
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Maybe we get a table,
I buy you a drink.

192
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Could you try it without the purse?

193
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah, sure.

194
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Well, you must be new here.
Maybe we sit--

195
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Can I ask you something?

196
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Sure. What?

197
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Well, first,
it's not a purse.

198
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Anytime.

199
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
If you think
it's a woman's bag, it's not.

200
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's a man's bag.

201
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Okay. And go!

202
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Let me show you the catalog.

203
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Look. See?

204
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's the latest thing.

205
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Everyone's got one.
Men, women, children.

206
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Do you sell these?

207
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
No, these babies sell themselves.

208
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Thank you.
That was great.

209
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But I didn't read anything.

210
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I think we've seen enough.

211
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
All right, I'll see you.

212
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
We got it. We got it.

213
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Is Rachel here?

214
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Listen, I just wanted to apologize
about the whole massage thing.

215
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I really like them.

216
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Please stop!

217
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
We're supposed to be honest.

218
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I wish you could tell me,
"I don't like your massages. "

219
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I don't like your massages.

220
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
See? It's no big deal.

221
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But now you're crying!

222
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm not crying about that.
I'm crying about something at work.

223
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
My boyfriend said
he didn't like my massages.

224
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You don't have
to be best at everything.

225
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Oh, my God!
You don't know me at all!

226
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You give the worst massages
in the world.

227
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm crying here!

228
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Look, hear me out.

229
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You give the best bad massages.

230
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
If anybody was looking
for the best bad massage. . .

231
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
. . .and they thought,
"Who's the best?"

232
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
They'd have to go to you.

233
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So you're saying that
if there was an award. . .

234
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
. . .for the best bad massage. . . .
Who would get that?

235
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It would be you!

236
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You, Monica!
And you'd get all the votes.

237
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So they could call the award,
"The Monica"?

238
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Absolutely.

239
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I suck!

240
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Thank you for meeting me.

241
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Thank you.

242
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Come sit.

243
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Sit.

244
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Sit!

245
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Alrighty.
Before we get started, I need you. . .

246
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
. . .to state for the record
that you are, in fact, Frank Buffay.

247
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Yes, I am.

248
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What did Frances leave me?

249
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That's why you wanted me to come.

250
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yes, she did. She left you. . .

251
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
. . .this lipstick.

252
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's used.

253
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Cool!

254
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I have just a few questions to ask,
so I'll get out my official forms.

255
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
So question one:

256
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You were married to Frances'
daughter, Lilly. Correct?

257
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Yes, I was.

258
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Question two:
Did that marriage end. . .

259
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
A: Happily?

260
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
B: Medium?

261
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Or C: ln the total abandonment. . .

262
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
. . .of her and her two children?

263
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It really says that?

264
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yeah, see?

265
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I guess then I would have to say C.

266
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Total abandonment.

267
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Reasons for abandonment:

268
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
A: Top secret government work.

269
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
B: Amnesia.

270
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Or C: You're just a selfish,
irresponsible. . .

271
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
. . .bad, bad man.

272
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I don't want the lipstick that much.

273
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Would you do me a favor?

274
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Would you give Lilly. . .

275
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
. . .that, please?

276
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
When you see Lilly,
give her that note.

277
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I wanted to talk to her
at the memorial. . .

278
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
. . .but I pictured her getting mad
the way you did, and I chickened out.

279
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I wrote her a note.
Give it to her, please?

280
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But you came to see Lilly?

281
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah. Why?

282
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Lilly's dead.

283
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
She what?

284
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
She's dead.

285
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Are you sure?

286
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
If she isn't, cremating her
was a big mistake.

287
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I can't believe this.
I just can't believe--

288
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
How?
Oh, my God.

289
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
How long ago?

290
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
1 7 years ago.

291
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What about the girls?

292
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Well, Ursula is a waitress
and she lives in Soho.

293
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And Phoebe. . .

294
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
. . .is on this couch.

295
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Yep, lipstick and a daughter.
Big day for you!

296
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Phoebe, l. . . .

297
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's just, I don't know what to say.

298
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I just can't believe that you're
my daughter. You're so pretty.

299
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yes, well, that's neither
here nor there.

300
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Would it make you feel
better if I said. . .

301
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
. . .that I was very, very sorry I left?

302
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It doesn't matter what you say.
It won't make a difference.

303
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
So you can just go.

304
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Well, you know, in my defense,
I was a lousy father.

305
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
-That's your defense?
-Yes, it is.

306
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I burned the formula,
and I put your diapers on backwards.

307
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I made up a song to sing to you,
but that made you cry even more.

308
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You make up songs?

309
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Well, no, just that one.
But it was stupid.

310
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Let's see, how did it go?

311
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Sleepy girl, sleepy girl

312
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Why won 't you go to sleep?

313
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Sleepy girl, sleepy girl

314
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You're keeping me up

315
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm not very good at this.

316
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Well, I am.

317
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Not yet. No.

318
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
How'd the audition go?

319
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Estelle said I didn't get it.

320
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What? Why?
Joey, you were so ready for it.

321
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I thought so too. . .

322
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
. . .but the casting people
had problems with me.

323
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
What kind of problem?

324
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
To tell you the truth. . .

325
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
. . .they had a problem with the bag!

326
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You know what?
It was a stupid play anyway.

327
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's time to give up the bag.

328
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I don't want to give up the bag.

329
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I don't have to give it up,
do l, Rach?

330
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You think I should give up the bag!

331
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Joey, I'm sorry. As terrific
as I think you are with it. . .

332
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
. . .I just don't know if the world
is ready for you and your bag.

333
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I can't believe this!

334
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Wait, I'm not saying
you shouldn't have a bag.

335
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
There are other bags
that are maybe a little less. . .

336
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
. . .controversial.

337
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Yeah, they're called wallets.

338
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy's
putting stuff in boxes.

339
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'd say our naked buddy is moving.

340
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Ironically, most of the boxes
seem to be labeled "Clothes. "

341
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm going to miss that big
old squishy butt.

342
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And we're done
with the chicken fried rice.

343
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
If he's moving, maybe I should
try to get his place!

344
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It would be so cool
to live across from you guys.

345
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
We could do that telephone thing. . .

346
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
. . .where you have a can,
we have a can. . .

347
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
. . .and it's connected by a string.

348
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Or we could do
the actual telephone thing.

349
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The One Where
Everyone Finds Out

350
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

351
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Oh, my God. I love this apartment!

352
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Isn't it perfect?

353
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I can't believe I never realized
how great it is!

354
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Because your eye goes
to the big naked man.

355
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It's amazing!

356
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Hurry up with an application,
or I'll beat you to it.

357
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Well, I'm going to use
Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.

358
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Look! There's Monica and Chandler.

359
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Hey, you guys!

360
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Chandler and Monica!

361
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Oh, my God!

362
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Oh, my eyes!

363
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
My eyes!

364
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's okay!

365
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
-They're doing it!
-I know!

366
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
-I know!
-You know?

367
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Yes, I know it. Joey knows,
but Ross doesn't, so stop screaming!

368
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
What's going on?

369
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
-What?
-Nothing!

370
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
We are so excited
that you'll get this apartment!

371
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Looks really good.

372
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Looks pretty good!

373
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Get in here!
Come on!

374
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You mean whenever
Monica and Chandler. . .

375
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
. . .were doing laundry
or going grocery shopping?

376
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
The time Monica spent on the phone
with Linda from camp?

377
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Doing it, doing it, phone, doing it.

378
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I can't believe it!

379
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I think it's great. For him.

380
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
She could do better.

381
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Hey, you guys.

382
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Come here!

383
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Phoebe found out
about Monica and Chandler.

384
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You mean how they're friends
and nothing more?

385
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Joey, she knows.

386
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
We saw them doing it
through the window.

387
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Actually, we saw them doing it
up against the window.

388
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So they know you know,
and they don't know Rachel knows?

389
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Yes, but it doesn't matter
who knows what.

390
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Now enough of us know
that we could just tell them we know.

391
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
All the lying and the secrets
will finally be over.

392
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Or, we could not tell them we know,
and have a little fun.

393
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
What do you mean?

394
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
If they say they are doing laundry,
we'll give them laundry to do.

395
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I would enjoy that.

396
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You know what would be even more fun?
Telling them.

397
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
No, I want to do Phoebe's thing.

398
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I can't take--

399
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
You don't have to do anything.
Just don't tell them we know.

400
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I can't take anymore secrets.

401
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I got your secrets, their secrets,
secrets of my own.

402
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You don't have any secrets.

403
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Well, you don't know about Hugsy,
my bedtime penguin pal.

404
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
How are we going to mess with them?

405
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
You could use your position
as the roommate.

406
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And I would use the strongest tool
at my disposal.

407
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
My sexuality.

408
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Hello, children.

409
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Watch. Learn.
And don't eat my cookie.

410
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
That jacket looks great on you.

411
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
-Really?
-The material is so soft.

412
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Hello, Mr. Bicep.

413
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
You're working out?

414
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I try to squeeze things.

415
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Are you okay?

416
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
If you really want to know--

417
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I can't tell you this.

418
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You can tell me anything.

419
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Actually, you are the one person
I can't tell this to.

420
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And the one person I want to the most.

421
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
What's going on?

422
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I just haven't been
with a guy in so long. . .

423
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
. . .and sometimes you're
looking for something. . .

424
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
. . .and it's right there
in front of you, sipping coffee. . . .

425
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Oh, no. Have I said too much?

426
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Just something to think about.
I know I will.

427
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You are so cute.

428
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
How did you get to be so cute?

429
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
My grandfather was Swedish.

430
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And my grandmother was
a tiny little bunny.

431
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Now you're even cuter.

432
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You know, that is a popular
opinion today, I must say.

433
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
The weirdest thing happened
at the coffeehouse.

434
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Phoebe was hitting on me.

435
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
What are you talking about?

436
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.

437
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
It's not possible.

438
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I'm sorry, Phoebe's just
always thought you were charming. . .

439
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
. . .in a sexless kind of way.

440
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
You know, I can't hear that enough.

441
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I just think you misunderstood her.

442
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I didn't, okay?
She was all over me.

443
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
She touched my bicep,
for crying out loud.

444
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
This bicep?

445
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Well, it's not flexed right now.

446
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Mon, you want to come
see a movie with us?

447
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Actually, I was going
to do some laundry.

448
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Want to do it with me?

449
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Sure, I'll do it with you.

450
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Okay, great.
Hold on a second.

451
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Here you go.

452
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
That would really help me out a lot.
Thanks.

453
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
You know what?
I don't have enough quarters.

454
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I have quarters!

455
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Hey, any word on the apartment yet?

456
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I called there, and it turns out
Naked Guy is subletting it.

457
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
He's already had 1 00 applicants.

458
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
No, I've got the edge.

459
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It's not exactly ethical,
but I sent him a bribe. . .

460
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
. . .to tip the scales in my direction.

461
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You can see it from the window.

462
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Is it that pinball machine
with the big bow on it?

463
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
That new mountain bike?

464
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
What did you send?

465
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
A basket of mini muffins.

466
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
There's a whole table of them.
Which one did you send?

467
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
The small one.

468
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
You actually thought that basket
was going to get you the apartment?

469
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Someone sent us a basket at work, and
people went crazy over those muffins.

470
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
It was the best day.

471
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Your work makes me sad.

472
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Oh, man, I want that place so much!

473
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And I was so sure
that was going to work.

474
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
There's 1 2 bucks
I'll never see again.

475
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
We'd better go if we want
to catch that movie.

476
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Bye.

477
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Bye, Chandler.
I miss you already.

478
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Did you see that? The inappropriate,
and the pinching?

479
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Actually, I did.

480
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So do you believe
that she's attracted to me?

481
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Oh, my God!
She knows about us!

482
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Are you serious?

483
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
She knows, and she's trying
to freak us out!

484
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
That's the only explanation!

485
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
But what about my pinchable butt
and my bulging biceps?

486
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
She knows!

487
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Phoebe knows about us.

488
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I didn't tell them!

489
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Them?

490
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Who's "them"?

491
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Phoebe and Joey.

492
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And Rachel.

493
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I would have told you,
but I promised not to tell.

494
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I'm sorry.

495
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
But it's over now, right?

496
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
You can tell them you know they know,
and I can go back to knowing nothing!

497
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Unless--

498
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Not "unless" !
This must end now!

499
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
They think they are so slick
messing with us.

500
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
But they don't know
that we know that they know.

501
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So--

502
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
The messers become the messees!

503
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Honey, you got to stop
torturing yourself.

504
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Why don't you find another apartment?

505
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I've already looked
at 1 000 apartments this month.

506
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
None of them even compares
to that one.

507
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
You know what?

508
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
You should find out his hobbies
and use that to bond with him.

509
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Like if I wanted something from Joey. . .

510
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
. . .I would strike up a conversation
about sandwiches. . .

511
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
. . .or my underwear.

512
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I'm listening.

513
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
That is a great idea!

514
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And I know Ugly Naked Guy because
we've been watching him for five years.

515
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
So that gives me back my edge!

516
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Let's see now.
He had the trampoline.

517
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
He broke that.

518
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
-He had gravity boots.
-He broke those too.

519
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
So he likes to break stuff.

520
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I've got to go pick up Ben.
But I will figure something out.

521
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Didn't he used to have a cat?

522
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I wouldn't bring that up.
It would bum him out.

523
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Poor cat never saw
that big butt coming.

524
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Hold on a second,
she's right here.

525
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
It's Chandler.

526
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Hello, you.

527
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Phoebe, I've been thinking
about you all day.

528
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
You know that thing you said before?
I was intrigued.

529
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Really?

530
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Joey won't be here tonight.

531
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Why don't you come over?
I'll let you feel my bicep.

532
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Or maybe more.

533
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I'll have to get back to you on that.

534
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
He wants me to come over
and feel his bicep and more!

535
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Are you kidding?

536
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I cannot believe
he would do that to Mon--

537
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Joey? Do they know that we know?

538
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
They know you know.

539
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I knew it!

540
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I cannot believe those two!

541
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
They thought they could mess with us?
Trying to mess with us?

542
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
They don't know that we know
they know we know.

543
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Joey, you can't say anything.

544
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Couldn't if I wanted to.

545
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Good evening, sir. I'm Ross Geller.
I'm one of the applicants.

546
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I realize that the competition
is fierce but. . . .

547
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I'm sorry, I can't help but notice
that you're naked.

548
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I applaud you.

549
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Man, I wish I was naked.

550
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I mean, this looks so great.

551
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
That is how God intended it.

552
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Look. They're panicked!

553
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
They'll totally back down.

554
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
If he wants a date,
he's going to get a date.

555
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm going to go in.

556
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Be sexy.

557
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Please.

558
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I'd love to come by tonight.

559
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Really?

560
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Absolutely.
Say, around seven?

561
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm really looking forward to you
and me having sexual intercourse.

562
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Hey, check it out!

563
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Naked Guy's got a naked friend.

564
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Oh, my God!
That's our friend!

565
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It's Naked Ross!

566
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Showtime!

567
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Rachel, get me perfume.

568
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Joey, can you get me
a bottle of wine and glasses?

569
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Make her think you want to have
sex with her and it will freak her out.

570
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
How far would I have to go with her?

571
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
She'll give in way before you do.

572
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
How do you know?

573
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Because you're on my team.
My team always wins.

574
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
At this?

575
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Just go get some! Go!

576
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Now, I'm going to try to listen
from right here.

577
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Oh, wait.

578
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Good idea.

579
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Don't give away the farm.

580
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Come on in.

581
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I was going to.

582
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I brought some wine.
Would you like some?

583
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Sure.

584
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
So here we are.

585
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Nervous?

586
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Me? No. You?

587
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I want this to happen.

588
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
So do l.

589
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I'm going to put on some music.

590
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Maybe I'll dance for you.

591
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
You look good.

592
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Thanks.

593
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You know, when you say
things like that, it makes me. . .

594
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
. . .want to rip that
sweater vest right off.

595
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Why don't we move into the bedroom?

596
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Really?

597
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Do you not want to?

598
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
First I want to take off
all my clothes. . .

599
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
. . .and have you rub lotion on me.

600
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
That would be nice.

601
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I'll go get the lotion.

602
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It's way out of hand.
She wants me to put lotion on her!

603
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
-She's bluffing!
-She's not backing down.

604
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
She went like this--

605
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
He's not backing down.
He went to get lotion.

606
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Aren't you guys done yet?

607
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I want to sit in my chair!

608
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
The sooner Phoebe breaks him, the sooner
it's over and out in the open.

609
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I like that.

610
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Show him your bra.
He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.

611
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
You didn't rip off any buttons.

612
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
It's not my first time.

613
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Go back there and seduce her
till she cracks!

614
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Give me a second.

615
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
-Did you clean up in here?
-Of course!

616
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
You're going?

617
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Not without you, lover.

618
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So, this is my bra.

619
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
It's very, very nice.

620
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Well, come here.

621
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I'm very happy we're going
to have all the sex.

622
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
You should be.
I'm very bendy.

623
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I'll kiss you now.

624
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Not if I kiss you first.

625
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I guess there's nothing
left for us to do but kiss.

626
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Here it comes.

627
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Our first kiss.

628
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
You win!

629
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I can't have sex with you!

630
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
-And why not?
-I'm in love with Monica!

631
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
You're what?

632
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Love her!

633
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I love her!

634
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I love her!

635
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I love you, Monica.

636
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I love you too, Chandler.

637
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I thought you were doing it.
I didn't know you were in love!

638
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Dude!

639
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Hats off to Phoebe.
Quite a competitor.

640
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
May I say your breasts
are still showing?

641
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
God.

642
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
All right!
So that's it?

643
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
It's over.
Everybody knows!

644
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Actually, Ross doesn't.

645
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
We'd appreciate it
if no one told him yet.

646
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
A new place for a new Ross.

647
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I'll have you and the guys from work
over, once it's furnished.

648
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It's nice to see you
back on your feet.

649
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I am that, and the whole rage thing
is definitely behind me.

650
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I wonder if it's time for you
to rejoin our museum team?

651
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
That would be great.

652
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I am totally ready
to come back to work.

653
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
What are you doing?

654
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Get off my sister!

655
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Chandler! Chandler!

656
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I saw what you were doing
in the window!

657
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I saw what you're doing to my sister!
Get out here!

658
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Listen, we had a good run.

659
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
What was it?
Four, five months?

660
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
That's more than most people
have in a lifetime. Goodbye.

661
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
-What are you doing?
-I am going on the lam.

662
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Come on, Chandler.
I can handle Ross.

663
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Hold on!

664
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Hey, Ross.
What's up, bro?

665
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
What the hell are you doing?

666
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
What's going on?

667
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I think Ross knows
about me and Monica.

668
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Dude, he's right there.

669
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I thought you were my best friend!
This is my sister!

670
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
My best friend and my sister!
I cannot believe this!

671
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
We're not just messing around.
I love her.

672
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I'm in love with her.

673
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I'm so sorry that you
had to find out this way.

674
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I'm sorry, but it's true.
I love him too.

675
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
My best friend and my sister!

676
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I cannot believe this!

677
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
You guys want to probably
get some hugs in too. Big news!

678
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
We've actually known for a while.

679
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
What? You guys knew?

680
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
You all knew and
you didn't tell me?

681
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
We were worried about you. We didn't
know how you were going to react.

682
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
You were worried about me?

683
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
You didn't know how I'd react?

684
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Okay. All right.

685
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Let's clear out of here and let
these love birds get back to business.

686
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I'm just talking here.
He's the one doing your sister.

687
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
The One with the Girl Who Hits Joey

688
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

689
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
You know what I just realized?

690
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
If you guys have kids--

691
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
We're having kids?

692
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I call godfather!

693
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
You can't just call godfather.

694
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Shouldn't her brother be godfather?

695
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Sure. If you cared enough
to call it first.

696
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
-You're a few steps ahead of us.
-Big zero gravity moon steps.

697
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I just thought of
the greatest wedding gift.

698
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I'll go in on that with you.
I couldn't decide.

699
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Hey, Katie.

700
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
This is Katie.

701
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
You ready to go?

702
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I'll run to the bathroom.

703
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Where's lunch?

704
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I was thinking Chinese food.

705
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I love Chinese!

706
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
How did you know I love Chinese?

707
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
She is so cute.

708
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
You could fit her
in your pocket.

709
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I don't know. I like her a lot,
and she's really nice, but. . . .

710
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
But what?

711
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
She keeps punching me.

712
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
In the cute little,
sweet way she just did?

713
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
It's a lot harder than it looks.

714
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
She's hurting me.

715
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I know what you need.
You need a bodyguard.

716
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
What is Ben doing after preschool?

717
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Joey is having a problem.
A little girl is beating him up.

718
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Joey, come here.

719
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Honey, I know. This must be
really difficult for you, and--

720
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I'm sorry, am I hurting you?

721
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I brought you some housewarming gifts.

722
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Salt, so your life always has flavor.

723
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Bread, so you never go hungry.

724
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
And a scented candle for the bathroom.

725
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Because, well, you know.

726
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Thanks. Thanks.
And thanks, I guess.

727
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Welcome. I'm Steve Cera,
President of the tenants' committee.

728
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Ross Geller.
And this is my friend Phoebe.

729
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Mr. President.

730
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I came to talk to you
about Howard.

731
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
He is the handyman
who's retiring next week.

732
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Everyone who lives here is kicking in
$1 00 as a kind of a thank you.

733
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
That's nice.

734
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Want to give me a check?

735
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Not now. You can
slip it under my door.

736
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
No, it's not that.

737
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I just moved in.

738
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Well, the guy's worked here
for 25 years.

739
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Yes, but I've lived here
for 25 minutes.

740
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Okay, I get it.

741
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Wait! Look, I'm sorry, it's just
I've never even met Howard.

742
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I mean, I don't know Howard.

743
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Howard's the handyman.

744
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Yes, but to me he's just "man. "

745
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Okay. Fine. Whatever.

746
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Welcome to the building.

747
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Can you believe that guy?

748
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I really like his glasses.

749
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
So then President Steve
told everyone I was a cheapskate. . .

750
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
. . .and now the whole building hates me.

751
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
A little kid spit on my knee.

752
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
You know what?

753
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I'll throw a party.
For everyone in the building.

754
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
And I'll sit them all down and
explain that I am not a bad guy.

755
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I am not a cheap guy.
I'm just a guy. . .

756
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
. . .who stands up
for what he believes in.

757
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
A man with principles.

758
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Sounds like a fun party.

759
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
If you want them to like you,
why don't you just pay the $1 00?

760
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
The party will cost you more.

761
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
That doesn't matter!

762
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
It's my principles!
We're talking about my principles!

763
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I thought it was about
your neighbors liking you.

764
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
They'll like me once
they come to my awesome par-tay.

765
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I gotta get some name tags.

766
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And that crazy party animal
will be your brother-in-law.

767
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Very funny.
But don't say that to Monica.

768
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Don't put any ideas in her head.

769
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
You do realize that those ideas
are probably already in Monica's head?

770
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Why?

771
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Well, because she loves you
and because you love her.

772
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Yeah, so? What's
that supposed to mean?

773
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Don't freak out! I'm telling you
something you already know.

774
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
She left Richard because
he didn't want to have babies.

775
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
And she is a woman. And she's
almost 30. And, you know, it's Monica.

776
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I don't see it that way.
I see two Monicas:

777
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
My friend who lives across
the hall and wants a lot of babies.

778
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
And the new Monica
who I started to date.

779
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Now, who is to say what she wants?

780
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I'm right.

781
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Am I right?

782
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
You're right.

783
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
You're absolutely right.
That makes everything different.

784
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
It's not different, is it?

785
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Not unless "different"
means the same.

786
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
You were so funny with that waiter.
You're such a nut!

787
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
You know, breadstick fangs
are always funny.

788
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
No, you make them funny.
You're the funny one!

789
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Look, Katie.
Listen, we need to talk, okay?

790
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Look, I like you.
I really do. I like you a lot.

791
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
But sometimes when you
playfully punch me like that. . .

792
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
. . .it feels like I'm being hit
with a very tiny but a very real bat!

793
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Like I could hurt you.

794
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Are you making fun of my size?

795
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Don't make fun of me
because of my size!

796
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Isn't this great?

797
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Couldn't you just
stay like this forever?

798
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Couldn't you just stay here forever?

799
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Yeah, here, somewhere else.
You know, wherever.

800
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Are you okay?

801
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I'm cool.

802
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Casual.

803
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
What are you doing?

804
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Just hanging out. Having fun
with the girl that I'm seeing casually.

805
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Man, I knew it!
I knew you'd do this.

806
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Get all freaked out because
everybody was joking about marriage!

807
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Well, you do want
all that stuff, right?

808
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
You know what I want?

809
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Yes! You want babies!
You have baby fever!

810
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I do not have baby fever!

811
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
You're obsessed
with babies and marriage. . .

812
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
. . .and everything that's
related to babies and marriage.

813
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Why don't we turn the heat
down on this pressure cooker!

814
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Have you lost your mind?

815
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
This isn't about me. This is about
you and your weird commitment crap!

816
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I know you. I know the thoughts
that you have in your head.

817
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
You don't know everything.

818
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Did you know I'm going out
with Rachel tonight instead of you?

819
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
And that the only baby here is you?

820
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Did you know I can't even
look at you now?

821
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I did not know that.

822
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
It'll be okay, right?
She won't leave me. This is fixable.

823
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
-Yeah, sure.
-Absolutely.

824
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
By me?

825
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Unless you make some big gesture.

826
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Big, though.

827
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
The missus!

828
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Gunther, can I get a coffee?

829
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
To go.

830
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I still don't want to talk to you.

831
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Tell me how to make things right.

832
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
That's what we do.

833
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I mess up, you tell me
how to fix it and I do.

834
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
And then you think I'm cute again.

835
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I'm really tired of being
your relationship tutor.

836
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Figure this out for yourself.

837
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
If you're afraid
of a real relationship. . .

838
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
. . .then don't be in one.

839
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Howard! Howard! Howard!

840
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Hi, Ross!

841
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
What are you doing here?

842
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I thought this was your party,
and it's a party for Howard.

843
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
He's the sweetest little man.

844
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
See you, Phoebe.
And thanks for chipping in.

845
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Oh, sure.

846
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
You chipped in?

847
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Yeah, $1 00.

848
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I can't believe you gave him money.

849
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I thought you agreed it was unreasonable
that they asked me for that money.

850
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
But they didn't ask me.

851
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I'm just the exotic, generous stranger.
That's always fun to be.

852
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
But you're making me look bad.

853
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
No, I'm not! lf anything,
I'm making you look better.

854
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
They'll see you
talking to me. I'm a hit.

855
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Hey, Pheebs!

856
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Hey, Ross.

857
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Maybe you two could
switch apartments.

858
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Because Phoebe is more
our kind of people.

859
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Think about it.

860
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Okay, my bad.

861
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
You look big.

862
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Thanks, I've been working out.

863
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Listen, is it obvious
I'm wearing six sweaters?

864
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
But it's not obvious why.

865
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I'm breaking up with Katie,
so I put on some extra padding.

866
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
If she hits me when she is happy,
can you imagine how hard she'll hit. . .

867
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
. . .when I take away the Joey love?

868
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Hey, cute jacket.

869
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Thanks.

870
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
-That's so sweet!
-Ouch!

871
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Did Joey tell you to say that?
You guys are too much!

872
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
You know what?
I got to tell you. . .

873
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
. . .I think you're the one
that is too much.

874
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Joey has the nicest friends.

875
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
And the nicest girlfriend.

876
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
You're so sweet!

877
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
You're so sweet!

878
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
She just kicked me.

879
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Aren't you going to do something?

880
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Do something or I'll walk
out that door right now.

881
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Are you going to?

882
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
This is a disaster.
Can't I please just go?

883
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I'm talking you up to people.

884
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Give it some time, relax.
Get something to eat.

885
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
What did you tell them about me?

886
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I told them about you and Emily.
Trying to get some sympathy.

887
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
But you came off as the bad guy.

888
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I told it wrong.

889
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
We should talk about that, because
I don't understand what happened there.

890
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
This cake is really good!

891
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Things are looking up.

892
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Oh, my God!
Someone cut Howard's cake!

893
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Who would do a thing like that?

894
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
3-B.

895
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
You got your free food.
You ruined everyone's fun.

896
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Isn't it time you went home?

897
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Go back to 3-B, 3-B.

898
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Everyone, calm down!
I have something that I'd like to say.

899
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Who here likes Ross?

900
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Of course you don't like him.

901
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
He didn't give you any money.

902
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
He raised his own hand
when I asked, "Who likes Ross?"

903
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
And he's wearing two name tags.

904
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I'll be honest. When I first met Ross,
I didn't like him at all.

905
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Once I got to know him,
I saw that he is really sweet. . .

906
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
. . .and caring and very generous.

907
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
All I'm saying is don't judge
Ross before you get to know him.

908
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
You know, I like all of you guys now.
But when I first met you, you know?

909
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Kurt? I thought, abrasive drunk.

910
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Lola?

911
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Mind-numbingly stupid.

912
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
You guys. Gold digger,
cradle-robbing perv.

913
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
So I think you all know what I mean.

914
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Obviously, I didn't think
they would throw things.

915
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I thought if I kept insulting them
you'd defend them.

916
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Then you'd look like the hero.

917
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
See, I did not get that.

918
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Where's Monica? I need
to talk to her, it's urgent.

919
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I'm Monica.

920
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I need to talk to you. It's urgent.

921
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I've been thinking. . .

922
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
. . .about us. A lot of "us" thinking.

923
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I guess there's
only one way to do this.

924
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
What are you doing?

925
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Don't do it.

926
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Will you marry me?

927
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
What a bad idea.

928
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I can't not look at it.

929
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Why are you doing this?

930
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I don't know.

931
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
But I know I'm not afraid to do this.

932
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?

933
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Do you think the best reason
to get married is because you're sorry?

934
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
The best reason is pregnancy.

935
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Sorry is fourth, behind being ready
and actually wanting to get married.

936
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Will you be my wife?

937
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,000
I want you to take a minute and think
about how ridiculous this sounds.

938
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I'm kind of wishing
everyone wasn't here now.

939
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
None of that came from me.

940
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I never said I wanted to have babies
and get married!

941
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I was really confused.
Then I talked to these guys.

942
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Who? Two divorces and Joey?

943
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
She's right, you know?

944
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!

945
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
You know when I said
that I want you. . .

946
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
. . .to deal with relationship stuff
all on your own?

947
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
You're not ready.

948
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I didn't think I was!

949
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Oh, my God.

950
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
What would you have done
if I had said yes?

951
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I would've been happy because. . .

952
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,000
. . .I would spend the rest of
my life with the woman I love.

953
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Or you would have seen
a Chandler-shaped hole in that door.

954
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Will you pass that knife?

955
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
No, I will not.

956
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
You don't have to be mean about it.

957
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
You're right. I'm sorry.
Will you marry me?

958
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I was going to ask you to marry me
because I didn't say hello to you.

959
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Or ask them to move in with you.
But I'm not sure. Chandler?

960
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
How long is this going to go on?

961
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
I think the length of teasing. . .

962
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
. . .is directly related to how insane
you were. So, a long time.

963
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
This is fun!

964
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Remember that
"we were on a break" thing?

965
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
I'm sorry.
Will you marry me?

966
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
That's not funny.

967
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
-What are you guys doing up?
-Finishing the crossword.

968
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Do you know a six-letter
word for "red"?

969
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Dark-red.

970
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Wrong, but there's a connect-the-dots
in here for you later.

971
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Hey, how about maroon?

972
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Yes! You are so smart!

973
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
You guys are so cute.

974
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I know.

975
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
See you in the morning.

976
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I love doing crossword
puzzles with you.

977
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Me too.

978
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Now let's finish this
and go to bed.

979
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Only one left.

980
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Three-letter word.
Not dog, but. . . .

981
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Cat.

982
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
You are so smart!

983
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
I love you.

984
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I love you too.

985
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
The One with a Cop

986
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

987
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
We still need a tip.

988
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
All right. Hold on.

989
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
I got it.

990
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Nickel.

991
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
-How much do we need?
-Couple of bucks.

992
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Okay, dime.

993
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
You guys keep talking.
This could take a while.

994
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Wait, look it!

995
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
This is a police badge!

996
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Cool. But why would a cop come
in here? They don't serve doughnuts.

997
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Can you discover the badge again?
I can do better than that.

998
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I bet somebody's
missing that badge.

999
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I should take it back.
But at the police station. . .

1000
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
. . .I'll check their
Ten Most Wanted.

1001
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
My friend's been Number 1 1 forever.
This could be her year!

1002
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey, Joey.

1003
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Is that my sweatshirt?

1004
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Yes, it is. I'm sorry.
I was cold. I hope it's okay.

1005
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
It's just that if you wear
someone's sweatshirt. . .

1006
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
. . .shouldn't it be your boyfriend's?

1007
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
And I'm not him.

1008
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
I'm sorry.
I'll give it back.

1009
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
It's going to be all
smelling like Monica.

1010
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Do I smell bad?

1011
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
You smell like a meadow.

1012
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
I'm sorry.

1013
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
What's with him?

1014
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
The last time Joey went to a meadow,
his mother was shot by a hunter.

1015
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I still don't know.

1016
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I want to make sure I bought
the right couch, one that says. . .

1017
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
. . . "Kids welcome here,"
but that also says. . .

1018
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
. . . "Come here to me. "

1019
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
What? You say that to kids?

1020
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,000
The "Come here to me" is,
you know, for the ladies.

1021
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Honey, it's a nice couch,
not a magic couch.

1022
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Well, you picked a great couch.

1023
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
-Sign here please.
-Sure.

1024
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
The delivery charge
is almost as much as the couch!

1025
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
That's ridiculous.
He lives three blocks away.

1026
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I'll take it myself.
Thank you.

1027
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
All right, Rach, come on.
Let's go.

1028
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Are you kidding?

1029
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Come on. It's only three blocks.
It's not very heavy. Try it.

1030
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Oh, I can do it.

1031
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
You two will really
enjoy that couch.

1032
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
We're not together.

1033
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Something didn't quite add up there.

1034
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
What's that supposed to mean?

1035
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Well, you. Her.

1036
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
I mean, she's very. . .

1037
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
. . .you know.

1038
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
And you're, like. . .

1039
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
. . .you know?

1040
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Not that it's any of your business,
but we did go out.

1041
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Really? You two?

1042
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I don't want to do this now.
I'm carrying a heavy couch.

1043
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Then tell him quickly.

1044
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Fine. We went out.

1045
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Not only did we go out. . .

1046
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
. . .we did it 298 times!

1047
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
You kept count?
You are such a loser!

1048
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
A loser you did it with 298 times!

1049
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Excuse me, ma'am. You can't put
your cigarette out on a tree.

1050
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Yeah, I can.
It worked well.

1051
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
But you shouldn't.
So don't ever do that again.

1052
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I won't till I have
my next cigarette.

1053
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Hold it!

1054
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
NYPD. Freeze, punk!

1055
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
That's right. You are so busted.

1056
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Book them.

1057
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
-Who are you talking to?
-Save it, red!

1058
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Apologize to the tree or
spend the night in the slammer.

1059
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I am not apologizing to a tree.

1060
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Apologize to the tree now,
or I am calling for backup.

1061
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Backup! Backup!

1062
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
I'm sorry! Sorry!

1063
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Okay, cancel backup!
Cancel backup!

1064
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Didn't you say there was
an elevator in here?

1065
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Yes, I did, but there isn't.
Here we go!

1066
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Okay, go left.

1067
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Left. Left.

1068
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Okay, you know what?
There's no more left left.

1069
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Lift it straight up over your head.

1070
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Straight up. You can do it!

1071
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
You can do it!

1072
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Okay. You got it?

1073
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
-Go, go.
-Good, good.

1074
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
You got it, right?
You got it, right? You got--

1075
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Any chance you think
it looks good there?

1076
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
This guy was all. . . .

1077
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
And I'm all,
"Buffay! Homicide! "

1078
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
It was just so cool!

1079
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,000
-You were supposed to take it back.
-I'm having fun doing good deeds.

1080
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
You can get arrested
for impersonating a police officer.

1081
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
You could get arrested
right now!

1082
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
I'd better take it back.
I'm totally drunk with power.

1083
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Yeah. I didn't know
you guys would be here.

1084
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
-Do me a favor. Taste this.
-What? Why?

1085
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
-What is with you?
-Nothing.

1086
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
You're acting strange.

1087
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
All right. There is something.

1088
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
I kind of had a dream.

1089
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
But I don't want to talk about it.

1090
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,000
What if Martin Luther King
had said that?

1091
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I kind of have a dream.

1092
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I don't want to talk about it.

1093
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Look, it involved Monica.

1094
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
You dreamt about the girl I'm seeing?
Cool.

1095
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
I dreamt about the girls he was seeing.

1096
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Let's talk about your dream.
I love you. Your dream?

1097
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
There was no sex.
I haven't dreamt of her like that. . .

1098
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
. . .since I found out
about you two-ish.

1099
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
What was the dream about?

1100
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
You were my girlfriend.
We were doing the crossword puzzle.

1101
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Like you did last night.

1102
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,000
That's it. I'm in love
with Monica. I'll move out.

1103
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Joey, come on. That doesn't mean
you're in love with me.

1104
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
It doesn't?

1105
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
It could mean anything.
Like. . .

1106
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
. . .you're jealous that I've become
the apartment stud.

1107
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Sounds like your dream.

1108
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Or it could mean you saw Chandler
and me being close and stuff. . .

1109
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
. . .and you want that too.

1110
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
In the dream
I did enjoy the closeness.

1111
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Are you attracted to Monica?

1112
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Right here, right now,
are you attracted to her?

1113
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
-Not really.
-There you have it!

1114
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Well, sure!
I'm just wearing sweats!

1115
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
But that's good!

1116
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
You're not in love with me.
You just want a girlfriend.

1117
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
It's not just about
getting a girlfriend.

1118
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I could get a girlfriend.
We could sit and do crossword puzzles.

1119
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
But could we have
the closeness like you have?

1120
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Monica and I were friends
before we dated. Maybe that's it.

1121
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Friends first?

1122
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
That's interesting.

1123
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,000
-You become friends after?
-No, never done that either.

1124
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Do you guys have the tape measure?

1125
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Yeah. It's actually in my bedroom.

1126
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
That's right.

1127
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
What's up, Joey?

1128
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
How you doing?

1129
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Excuse me. Is this your car?

1130
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Don't park here.
You're blocking the entrance.

1131
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Don't worry.
It's not a problem.

1132
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
It's a problem for me, so it's a
problem for you because I'm a cop.

1133
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
So am l.

1134
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Okay. So you're a cop.
You can park anywhere.

1135
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I know because I'm a cop too.

1136
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Keep up the good work.
Ten four.

1137
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Wait. So what precinct
are you with?

1138
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
I'm with the 57th.

1139
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
-I know a guy in Homicide up there.
-I'm in Vice.

1140
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,000
In fact, I'm undercover
right now. I'm a whore.

1141
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Who else is in Vice there?

1142
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Do you know. . .

1143
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
. . .Sipowitz?

1144
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Sipowitz? I don't think so.

1145
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Yeah. Sipowitz. Yeah.
Big guy, kind of bald.

1146
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
I don't know him.

1147
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Don't try to call him.
He's not there. He's out.

1148
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
His partner just died.

1149
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Tell Sipowitz I'm real sorry
for his loss.

1150
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I sure will. Take care.

1151
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
By the way, Sipowitz
will be all right.

1152
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
That kid from Silver Spoons
is really good.

1153
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Where'd you find my badge?

1154
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Could you give me and Ross
a hand moving his couch?

1155
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
I'd love to but I got acting class.
But you know what?

1156
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I guess I could blow that off. . .
. . .or you.

1157
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Let me ask you something.
I was talking with Monica and Chandler.

1158
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Boy, they are really tight.

1159
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
I know.

1160
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,000
That's not a bad situation
they got there.

1161
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Think I'll get me one of those.

1162
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
What's up, Joe?

1163
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
I think Monica and Chandler
are so great. . .

1164
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,000
. . .because they were friends first.

1165
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,000
So I asked myself, who are my friends?
You and Phoebe.

1166
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
I saw you first, so. . . .

1167
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
-What are you saying?
-Maybe you and I crank it up a notch.

1168
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
You know, honey. . .

1169
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,000
. . .as flattered as I am. . .

1170
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
. . .that you saw me first. . .

1171
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
. . .I just don't think we should be
cranking anything up.

1172
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
I'll treat you real nice.

1173
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Yeah. Well, you know. . . .

1174
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:12,000
I think it's a great idea to become
friends with someone before you date.

1175
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,000
But the way you do it is you
meet someone, become their friend. . .

1176
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
. . .build a foundation,
then ask them out on a date.

1177
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Don't hit on your existing friends.

1178
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Won't that take longer?

1179
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Oh, but once you find it. . .

1180
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
. . .it's so worth the wait.

1181
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I understand.

1182
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Good.

1183
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first.

1184
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Come here to me.

1185
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
No, no. You come here to me.

1186
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
-I brought reinforcements.
-Great! You brought Joey?

1187
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
The next best thing.

1188
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
You brought Chandler?
The next best thing would be Monica!

1189
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I would be offended, but Monica
is freakishly strong, so. . . .

1190
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
I drew a sketch
of how we'll do it.

1191
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Rach, that's you.

1192
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
That's the couch.

1193
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
What's that?

1194
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
That's me.

1195
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Certainly think a lot of yourself.

1196
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
No. That's my arm.

1197
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,000
I see. I thought you just really,
really liked your new couch.

1198
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Just follow my lead.

1199
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Come on, Chandler.

1200
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
-All right.
-Okay.

1201
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Here we go.

1202
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
All right. Ready?

1203
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Turn!

1204
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Turn!

1205
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Turn!

1206
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,000
-I don't think we can turn anymore!
-I don't think it'll fit!

1207
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Yeah, it will.
Come on! Up, up, up!

1208
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Up! Yes!

1209
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Here we go! Pivot!

1210
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Pivot!

1211
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Pivot!

1212
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Pivot!

1213
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Pivot!

1214
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Pivot!

1215
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

1216
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
I don't think it'll pivot anymore.

1217
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
You think?

1218
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
All right, let's bring it
back down and try again.

1219
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I think it's really stuck now.

1220
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
-I can't believe that didn't work.
-I know. Me neither.

1221
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
I mean, you had a sketch.

1222
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
What did you mean when
you said "pivot"?

1223
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,000
How's it going?
Make any new friends?

1224
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Yeah.
I met this woman.

1225
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
What's she like?

1226
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Well, she's. . .

1227
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
. . .really good in bed.

1228
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,000
-You were going to be friends first.
-Hey, it's all your fault.

1229
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Why?

1230
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
You didn't give me advice.
You gave me a pickup line.

1231
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
I told her I wanted to
"build a foundation and be friends. "

1232
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Suddenly, through no fault of my own,
I became irresistible to her!

1233
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
And her roommate!

1234
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
What about the "closeness"?

1235
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Closeness, schmosness! There was
three of us, for crying out loud!

1236
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Who wants pizza?

1237
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I do! I do! I do!

1238
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
This is great! Can you believe
I found it on the second floor?

1239
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
-Who is it?
-NYPD.

1240
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Oh, my God!

1241
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Just a minute, officer!

1242
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,000
-I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay.
-My God, it's him! It's that cop!

1243
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,000
-I can't believe he found me!
-Are you going to go to jail?

1244
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,000
If I go down,
you guys go down with me.

1245
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Harboring a fugitive?
That's one-to-three years minimum.

1246
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Good luck, Chandler.

1247
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Arrest me, but you'll never
make it stick and you know it.

1248
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
I have no choice, it's my job.
You understand, right?

1249
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
And you understand that
I'm calling my lawyer.

1250
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,000
And once he puts you on the stand
he'll make you look like a fool!

1251
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
I don't like looking foolish.

1252
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Maybe I don't arrest you today.
Maybe I came by and you weren't here.

1253
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
I'd love it if I weren't here!

1254
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Since you're not going to jail tonight,
I was wondering if you'd. . .

1255
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
. . .Iike to go to dinner with me?

1256
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Me?

1257
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Ever since you flashed my badge,
I can't stop thinking about you.

1258
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,000
You're the prettiest fake
undercover whore I've ever seen.

1259
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Nice.

1260
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Wow, I didn't see that coming.
You're asking me out.

1261
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I could've done it better,
but they're staring at me.

1262
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I'd like to go out
with you, officer.

1263
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
-Gary.
-Gary.

1264
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Okay, so it's a date.

1265
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
I got to ask you, though.
How'd you find me?

1266
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
I ran your fingerprints
through the computer.

1267
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
This was listed
as your last known address.

1268
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Impressive.

1269
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Not as impressive as you. Your record
shows you've done some weird stuff.

1270
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
We'll talk at dinner.

1271
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,000
-So I'll come by and pick you up?
-I can't wait.

1272
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Don't worry, I won't just
take you out for doughnuts.

1273
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
He has a gun!

1274
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I'd like to return this couch.
I'm not satisfied with it.

1275
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
You want to return this couch?

1276
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
It's cut in half.

1277
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,000
-That's what I'm telling you.
-Did you cut this couch in half?

1278
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,000
This couch is cut in half!

1279
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,000
I would like to exchange it for one
that is not cut in half.

1280
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
You're saying this couch was
delivered to you like this?

1281
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Look, I'm a reasonable man.

1282
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
I will accept store credit.

1283
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,000
I'll give you store credit
in the amount of four dollars.

1284
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I will take it.
