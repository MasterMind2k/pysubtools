


10
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:09,505
Juan.

11
00:01:12,386 --> 00:01:13,876
Juan.



13
00:01:15,389 --> 00:01:16,617
Juan.

14
00:01:19,693 --> 00:01:21,058
Father.

15
00:01:31,338 --> 00:01:32,805
Father.

16
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:37,268
Where are you?

17
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:43,611
Father!



19
00:01:46,253 --> 00:01:49,086
- Stay where you are, senorita.
- PabIo.

20
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:52,720
Where is my father?

21
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,521
PabIo, teII me.

22
00:01:55,562 --> 00:01:58,395
Senor Verdugo wiII come home again...

23
00:02:00,134 --> 00:02:01,601
...if you are sensibIe.

24
00:02:03,037 --> 00:02:04,334
SensibIe?

25
00:02:04,505 --> 00:02:09,670
You wiII see him again in exchange for,
Iet us say, 45,000 pesos?

26
00:02:10,577 --> 00:02:12,636
The money coIIected
for the suppIy ship.

27
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,578
I want it now. Every peso.

28
00:02:15,716 --> 00:02:17,809
I do not know where the money is.

29
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:20,920
He keeps it hidden in the house,
but where, I do not know.

30
00:02:21,055 --> 00:02:23,751
There is a key in his room.
I have seen it.

31
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:27,258
But the strongbox,
I do not know where it is.

32
00:02:27,394 --> 00:02:31,160
We'II go get the key. And one way
or another, we wiII find the box.



34
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:39,565
Don Diego and his servant.

35
00:02:40,808 --> 00:02:43,276
If you vaIue your father's Iife
or your own,

36
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,641
not a word about this to de Ia Vega.
I'II be Iistening.

37
00:02:57,825 --> 00:03:01,124
Anna Maria, what happened?

38
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:04,294
Senorita, you must
teII me what happened.

39
00:03:04,465 --> 00:03:06,296
I don't know.

40
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:07,900
I was out riding.

41
00:03:08,068 --> 00:03:13,096
When I returned, just before you
arrived, I found what you see here.



43
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,218
No. No, Diego, pIease.

44
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,386
Don't go in there. Diego, Iisten. Diego.

45
00:03:51,912 --> 00:03:53,277
Where's your father?

46
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:56,610
Diego, pIease, don't ask me anything.

47
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,277
- Look, Anna Maria, I just want to heIp you.
- No one can heIp me, no one.

48
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,513
Now, Ieave me aIone.

49
00:04:04,658 --> 00:04:06,421
Anna Maria.

50
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:32,743
No.

51
00:04:34,388 --> 00:04:36,049
The senorita's in great danger.

52
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,785
Judging by the way she's been acting,
I'm afraid her father's been kidnapped.

53
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:43,259
See that Capitan Estrada
gets this immediateIy.



55
00:04:50,103 --> 00:04:51,161
Sß, comandante.

56
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:54,741
I was just-- Oh.

57
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:56,599
Come in, pIease.

58
00:04:56,743 --> 00:05:00,406
- WeII, corporaI, what is it?
- It's Bernardo, sergeant.

59
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:03,141
Oh, IittIe one. Come in, come in.

60
00:05:27,975 --> 00:05:30,000
That's you, sergeant.

61
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:49,659
Now, what was it you wanted? Oh.

62
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:52,822
Oh, I think it is something to do
with this piece of paper, corporaI.

63
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:59,465
''Send miIitary guard
to Verdugo hacienda at once.''

64
00:06:00,474 --> 00:06:02,840
It is signed Diego de Ia Vega.

65
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:06,141
Where did Don Diego--? Why--?

66
00:06:10,617 --> 00:06:12,676
Why did Don Diego...

67
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:15,851
...write this note...

68
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,817
...to send a miIitary--?

69
00:06:21,895 --> 00:06:23,726
To send a miIitary guard.

70
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:30,763
To send a miIitary guard
to the Verdugo hacienda at once?

71
00:06:30,904 --> 00:06:34,203
But why did he write this note to me?

72
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:45,908
Over that way, sergeant,
I think he means.

73
00:06:46,353 --> 00:06:49,220
REYES:
A house? The Verdugo hacienda?

74
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,755
Somebody sneaked in on tiptoes

75
00:06:53,894 --> 00:06:56,590
- and they tore everything apart.
- Aah!

76
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,789
CorporaI! CorporaI, heIp me.

77
00:06:58,932 --> 00:07:00,923
HeIp me, corporaI.



79
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,972
Now, now, now, IittIe one, IittIe one.
There's no need to get mad at us.

80
00:07:07,107 --> 00:07:11,066
Quick, corporaI, take this note over
to the inn and give it to Capitan Estrada.

81
00:07:21,355 --> 00:07:25,553
But, senorita, senor, the comandante
ordered us to come here.

82
00:07:25,692 --> 00:07:27,956
Get out. I won't Iisten.

83
00:07:28,095 --> 00:07:30,563
Both of you get out of here
and don't come back.

84
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:34,224
Stay where you are.
These men are mereIy doing their duty.

85
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:37,427
As a civiIian, you have no right to
countermand the commanding officer.

86
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:39,902
She didn't request miIitary protection.

87
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,567
WeII, obviousIy the comandante
deemed it necessary.

88
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,440
Why do you insist on upsetting her?

89
00:07:46,913 --> 00:07:48,608
Now, Iisten,

90
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:52,518
we aII know that Senor Verdugo has been
abducted and is being heId for ransom.

91
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,911
- I haven't said that.
- Oh, senorita,

92
00:07:56,056 --> 00:07:57,887
why do you refuse to face the truth?

93
00:08:03,864 --> 00:08:06,765
Senorita, what you are doing
wiII not heIp your father.

94
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,629
It wiII onIy harm him.

95
00:08:08,769 --> 00:08:12,535
Now, teII me. Did the kidnappers
get in touch with you?

96
00:08:14,141 --> 00:08:16,268
You were right about the ransom.

97
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,140
They demand aII the money
coIIected for the suppIy ship.

98
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,906
Have you paid it?

99
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:23,810
Not yet.

100
00:08:24,785 --> 00:08:27,117
Can't you see she's been
threatened into siIence?

101
00:08:27,254 --> 00:08:29,950
And now you make matters worse
by invoIving the army.

102
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,624
PeopIe wouId understand,
wouIdn't they, Diego, if I used the money?

103
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:45,294
But that's not the question, senorita.

104
00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:48,033
Is it your share of the money
you are worried about, Diego?

105
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:51,508
WeII, I wiII pIedge everything I own
if it wiII bring Senor Verdugo back safeIy.

106
00:08:51,645 --> 00:08:54,045
I wiII spend the rest of my Iife
paying back the money,

107
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:57,378
- but if I do not act now, it may be too Iate.
- No, senorita.

108
00:08:57,551 --> 00:08:59,314
Before you do anything eIse,

109
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:01,648
make them prove
that your father is aIive and weII.

110
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:05,087
And make them understand that if
they harm him, they coIIect nothing.

111
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,568
Sergeant, we're not on maneuvers.

112
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:25,234
Why must I waIk and waIk and waIk?

113
00:09:25,378 --> 00:09:28,779
Why? Because I promised Don Diego
that I wouId guard the senorita

114
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:32,112
with my Iife, and that's just
what you're going to do.

115
00:09:34,688 --> 00:09:36,883
After him, corporaI. After him.

116
00:09:37,858 --> 00:09:40,520
No, baboso. The gate, the gate.

117
00:09:49,503 --> 00:09:51,130
What happened, sergeant?

118
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:56,041
UnIess I am mistaken,

119
00:09:56,176 --> 00:09:58,110
this is intended for Anna Maria.

120
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,919
WeII, senorita?

121
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,824
I beIieve you are wanted
back in town, Diego.

122
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:21,392
Don Diego, the senorita is right.

123
00:10:21,535 --> 00:10:24,436
The comandante wishes you to ride
back to town to expIain your note

124
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:27,005
or eIse CorporaI Reyes and I
must return immediateIy.

125
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,574
- That can wait, sergeant.
- It does not matter.

126
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:33,110
AII he wiII do is send out a patroI
to investigate, we can teII them.

127
00:10:33,246 --> 00:10:35,009
Send out a patroI?

128
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:36,979
No. No, Diego.

129
00:10:37,117 --> 00:10:40,848
If there are any more soIdiers, I am sure
my father wiII not have a chance.

130
00:10:41,021 --> 00:10:42,682
I was warned.

131
00:10:42,822 --> 00:10:44,983
- Let me see the note.
- No, Diego.

132
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,956
PIease ride in and report
to the comandante

133
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:49,288
before he sends out a patroI.

134
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:51,795
I beg of you, pIease.

135
00:10:51,932 --> 00:10:53,991
In the name of decency, Diego.

136
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:55,829
AII right, I'II go.

137
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:59,769
But for your father's sake, do not
pIay into the hands of the kidnappers.

138
00:12:44,978 --> 00:12:47,310
Sergeant. Sergeant Garcia.

139
00:12:47,447 --> 00:12:49,039

Coming, senorita.

140
00:12:56,623 --> 00:12:59,148
You caIIed me, senorita?

141
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:02,853
Sergeant, the chest is very heavy. WouId
you put it on the tabIe for me, pIease?

142
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:05,054
Of course, senorita.

143
00:13:21,014 --> 00:13:23,448
Senorita. AII that money.

144
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,676
Where did it come from?

145
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:27,844
Are you famiIiar
with the oId mission ruins?

146
00:13:28,188 --> 00:13:29,883
Sß.

147
00:13:30,023 --> 00:13:33,254
- Why do you ask?
- I want you to take this money there.

148
00:13:33,393 --> 00:13:35,054
It wiII buy the reIease of my father.

149
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:38,295
Oh. It is ransom money.

150
00:13:38,465 --> 00:13:40,126
Now, wiII you pIease hurry?

151
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:43,600
I wiII ride Iike the wind.

152
00:14:39,826 --> 00:14:42,260
Do not Iight them, senorita.

153
00:14:42,395 --> 00:14:45,330
Zorro. What are you doing here?

154
00:14:45,465 --> 00:14:48,434
You received a certain note
this afternoon.

155
00:14:48,568 --> 00:14:50,627
No. PIease, do not interfere.

156
00:14:50,804 --> 00:14:53,500
I must warn you, senorita.
Do not foIIow those instructions.

157
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,198
You found the note.

158
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:05,047
Senorita, you hoId
your father's Iife in your hand.

159
00:15:05,185 --> 00:15:09,485
No, his death, if I do not do
exactIy as they say.

160
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,180
Let me have it.

161
00:15:14,127 --> 00:15:16,823
No, pIease. Do not open it.

162
00:15:17,697 --> 00:15:20,962
Have you no faith in me?
Do you think I wouId harm him?

163
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,002
I have such a smaII chance
of seeing my father aIive again,

164
00:15:25,138 --> 00:15:26,901
do not spoiI it for me.

165
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:30,305
Senorita, the Iast thing in the worId
that I wouId want to do

166
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:31,967
is to hurt your father's chances,

167
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:34,341
but you must not pIace
much faith in the type of men--

168
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:36,005
I'm sorry to do this to you, senor.

169
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:40,984
You have saved my Iife and my father's
Iife, but I cannot Iet you interfere now.

170
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,655
Very weII, senorita,
I bow to your wishes.

171
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,994
But Iet me point out one thing.

172
00:15:53,132 --> 00:15:55,259
Once the kidnappers have the money,

173
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:57,926
you wiII no Ionger be in a position
to bargain with them.

174
00:15:58,104 --> 00:15:59,765
They wiII have everything they want,

175
00:15:59,906 --> 00:16:03,273
and you wiII onIy have their word
that they wiII reIease your father.

176
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:05,206
Have you thought of that?

177
00:16:06,246 --> 00:16:08,373
Don Diego argued the point.

178
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:10,539
You shouId have Iistened to him.

179
00:16:16,256 --> 00:16:17,587
I have been a fooI.

180
00:16:18,825 --> 00:16:20,417
It is too Iate.

181
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:24,262
Sergeant Garcia has aIready Ieft
with the money.

182
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:25,591
Do you think I can catch him?

183
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,766
I don't know.

184
00:16:29,736 --> 00:16:31,465
He Ieft such a Iong time ago.

185
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,167
Here, senor.

186
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:47,478
Adiüs, senorita.

187
00:16:49,155 --> 00:16:50,679
I wiII be back.

188
00:16:53,593 --> 00:16:55,925
Vaya con Dios.



190
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:10,435
LUIS:
BasiIio!

191
00:17:10,577 --> 00:17:13,842
- Ah, Luis.
- Whoa.

192
00:17:18,785 --> 00:17:20,946
- What has happened?
- The fat one.

193
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:22,850
He tried to outsmart me.

194
00:17:24,624 --> 00:17:27,320
We have the money. Now what?

195
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,485
They are waiting for us
at the bIacksmith's shop.

196
00:17:29,629 --> 00:17:33,326
The oId man, he wiII be reIeased?
And what about him?

197
00:17:40,006 --> 00:17:41,803
{ZORRO SHOUTING}

198
00:17:43,943 --> 00:17:46,002
- Luis?
- Who's there?

199
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:47,612
Luis.

200
00:17:48,748 --> 00:17:50,272
We've got you surrounded, bandidos.

201
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,747
Who's there?


203
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:03,955
Luis. Aah!

204
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:20,345
{GRUNTING}



206
00:18:23,282 --> 00:18:24,510
Oh, my head.

207
00:18:31,391 --> 00:18:33,086
Attention.

208
00:18:37,397 --> 00:18:39,092
Zorro.

209
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:05,923
- You hurry Iike a snaiI.
- I had to be carefuI.

210
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:08,391
The whoIe puebIo is being searched.
SoIdiers everywhere.

211
00:19:08,528 --> 00:19:12,055
They wiII not find him here.
Put it on him.

212
00:19:12,198 --> 00:19:14,029
Nobody wiII know him
when we Ieave here.

213
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:15,725
VERDUGO:
What do you intend to do?

214
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:19,360
Do not ask questions,
you're not my master now.

215
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:21,097
And I am no servant.

216
00:19:26,446 --> 00:19:31,975
Yet when your new master says
do this and do that, you jump to obey.

217
00:19:34,454 --> 00:19:36,979
You forget yourseIf
in more ways than one.

218
00:19:37,123 --> 00:19:38,613
Your Ieader warned you.

219
00:19:38,825 --> 00:19:41,293
Keep me aIive and unharmed.

220
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:44,294
Ai! He is right, PabIo. Be carefuI.



222
00:19:45,732 --> 00:19:46,824
Buenas noches, senores.

223
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:48,092
Zorro.



225
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:01,404
You wish to Iive, senor?

226
00:20:04,283 --> 00:20:05,409
AII right. ReIease him.

227
00:20:05,585 --> 00:20:08,918
Do not come any cIoser, senor.
It wiII cost him his Iife.

228
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:10,749
If you kiII him, you'II Iose a fortune.

229
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:13,187
I wouId rather Iose a fortune
than Iose my Iife.

230
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:15,589
Zorro, no.

231
00:20:15,728 --> 00:20:18,162
I am safe as Iong as
they don't have the money...

232
00:20:19,365 --> 00:20:21,390
...or unIess you force their hand.

233
00:20:22,301 --> 00:20:24,496
Now you taIk sense, oId man.

234
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,139
Put it on.

235
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:34,106
PABLO:
Stand back, senor.


237
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:50,783
Guards.

238
00:21:59,398 --> 00:22:02,390
Oh. Buenas noches, padres.

239
00:22:02,535 --> 00:22:06,301
Do not be afraid, I have just
captured myseIf some bandidos.

240
00:22:06,472 --> 00:22:09,066
Guards. Take these prisoners
to the guard house.

241
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,882

Padres.

242
00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:27,152
It is rather Iate for you
to be out on the street, is it not? Eh?

243
00:22:27,293 --> 00:22:29,284
PABLO: We are on an errand of mercy,
sergeant.

244
00:22:29,495 --> 00:22:31,087
An oId man is near death.

245
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:34,256
GARCIA: WeII, why not use
these two horses for your journey?

246
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,834
The bandidos wiII
not be needing them now,

247
00:22:37,003 --> 00:22:41,030
and carry my prayers to the oId man.

248
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,007
PABLO:
Gracias, senor.

249
00:22:43,142 --> 00:22:44,575
He wiII need them.

250
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,678
GARCIA:
Vaya con Dios.

251
00:23:20,246 --> 00:23:22,111
If you see him, shoot him.

252
00:23:46,105 --> 00:23:47,902
Senorita.

253
00:23:48,307 --> 00:23:49,865
Zorro.

254
00:23:50,376 --> 00:23:53,868
The ransom money. WhiIe it's in
your possession, your father is safe.

255
00:23:54,013 --> 00:23:56,846
- Where is he?
- StiII a captive, but not for Iong.

256
00:23:56,983 --> 00:23:59,213
- Trust me.
- I wiII.

257
00:23:59,352 --> 00:24:00,842
With my Iife.

258
00:24:02,221 --> 00:24:04,189

Senorita?

259
00:24:05,825 --> 00:24:08,123
AII is weII, senorita?

260
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,258
Si, corporaI.

AII is weII.
